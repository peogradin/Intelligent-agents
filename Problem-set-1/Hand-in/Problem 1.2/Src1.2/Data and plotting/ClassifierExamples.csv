Text: "hong kong to london via beijing. worst airline i have ever tried, from their online services to the flight quality. their website is a joke, it keeps timing out and it doesn't allow you to checkin for flights that have intermediate stops. i have complained to one of their staff at the airport and they admitted that they have issues with their online check-in. the plane was also a joke, especially the one used to fly from beijing to london. i'm 188cm tall, i didn't have enough legroom and my knee were pushed against the sit in front of me for 11 hours! the legroom was less than in a cheap low cost airline (e.g. ryanair), how can that happen in an international flight where you need to be sit for more than ten hours! let's ignore the cleanliness and comfort, but a minimum amount of legroom should always be provided. the flight entertainment was also embarrassing, straight out of the nineties, the resolution of the display was probably the same as one of the first smartphone ever produced, it was painful to watch, and the controllers of the entertainment system were unintuitive and most of the buttons to press were unresponsive. the meal quality was really poor, food was just a little warm, they gave us two options for the meals and they ran out of the first option immediately, i think they managed to serve maybe ten persons and then they ran out of it, speechless! to conclude our trip properly they damaged one of our luggage, we found the luggage completely open running around on the belt at the luggage collection, we obviously filled in an official complaint as part of the content was broken/lost. i think, no matter how cheap their flights are, we will never book a flight with them, worst experience ever!",	 Predicted class: 0,	 Actual class:0
Text: "inhumane seats. i fly constantly, maybe 50 flights a year. these are the worst seats i've ever "fit" in. i weigh about 210 and am 5' 11". i have shortish legs for my height. still i can point my knees forward as they press into the seat in front of me. every move the person makes in front of me, i feel. now. i flew on points. so even with my air canada status they shoved me to the back of the plane (with my wife). they should be ashamed. my wife actually felt claustrophobic. air canada. anything for a buck.",	 Predicted class: 0,	 Actual class:0
Text: "our flight was late arriving in ho chi min for our flight to moscow with no apology from the crew. they let passengers onto the flight who had been drinking heavily and nothing was said or done to turn them away the crew were unhelpful and sullen the food was inedible. on arriving in moscow we thought we still had time to catch our next flight to london heathrow only to be told the flight had already left. when we arrived at the desk we were given tickets for the next day and told we would be in a hotel for the night. no apologies there was a lot of shrugging of shoulders and being told to sit over there. rude and very unhelpful.",	 Predicted class: 0,	 Actual class:0
Text: "miami to mexico city was a very bad experience. a 3 hr flight became a 9 hr flight because they make us stop in another airport - for almost 4 hours. there we sat inside the plane, they didn't let us get down for a meal, drink etc. arguing it was an international flight. a bad, very bad experience.",	 Predicted class: 0,	 Actual class:0
Text: "ho chi minh city to newark via beijing. the absolute worst airline i have ever flown with. for starters they boarded us at 10:30am and we did not leave until after 2pm. they gave us no reason why, the weather was perfect and there were all types of rumors flying to where they could not get approval for us to fly over russia. the staff is extremely rude, unpleasant and speaks next to no english not even understanding basic questions about food and drinks. at one point the staff told me and my neighbor sitting next to me we had to be quiet. mind you we were talking quiet and politely. a couple hours later a couple of chinese women were rudely talking basically where anyone and everyone could hear, but of course the staff said nothing to them. the food is disgusting and the only snack they offer is card board bread with a slice of fake ham. then when i finally arrive at my destination they announce my name and then tell me my luggage was left in ho chi minh city and it would be delivered to me 2 days later. finally 2 and a half days later i get my luggage and the lock is missing and you can tell my luggage has been opened. i will never fly with this disgraceful airline again and i advise you too avoid them at all costs. i almost forgot to mention my tv monitor did not work, but it did not matter 95% of the movies were all chinese flicks.",	 Predicted class: 0,	 Actual class:0
Text: "prague to toronto. violin cruise line booked my sister and me on air canada from prague to toronto. little did i know that the flight was on air canada rouge that doesn't have movies/headphone jacks and expects one to know that one must fly with their own ipad and headphones plus download the air canada app prior to takeoff. they mention downloading the app but i did not realise it is mandatory to do so to be able to watch movies on one's cell phone or ipad until one is in the air and it is too late! (unless you wish to rent their ipad). it was nearly 9 hours in a seat that did not recline with discount beverages and lousy meals.",	 Predicted class: 1,	 Actual class:0
Text: "delhi-barcelona. i could not check-in online so called up the airlines to find my flight was re-scheduled. my connecting flight had been rescheduled so that my transit took 24 hrs and they wouldn't provide any sort of accommodation. moscow airport contains narrow corridors with duty free shops food must be paid with russian money. there was free internet but only in a few places with low wifi signal. plane food was bland and mediocre. average service.",	 Predicted class: 1,	 Actual class:0
Text: "london gatwick to toronto with air canada rouge during august 2016. this was a very poor flight. there many faults. first, there was no inflight entertainment at all. we were told that there was inflight wifi but this did not work. very disappointing on such a long flight. the food was also poor and the announcements on the tannoy system were frequently inaudible. but by far, the worst aspect of the flight was the very limited legroom available. i am over 6' tall, and i struggled to find a comfortable position throughout this flight. on a long 8 hour flight i would have expected more room. i have flown many times with other carriers and have had adequate leg room on longer flights. i have also sometimes flown on short european low cost airline carriers with more legroom than this, and they are much cheaper carriers. what is surprising is that we flew a much shorter connecting flight (just over 4 hours) from toronto to victoria bc with air canada and had all the facilities that i described above. so why did air canada rouge not provide a better service for the much longer leg of the journey? i don't like to sound so negative and would not give negative feedback easily but this carrier were very poor value for money.",	 Predicted class: 1,	 Actual class:0

Text: "super convenient 3 pm departure from delhi. only direct flight from delhi to madrid. excellent legroom in economy class - more than any other long-haul airline i have been on. adequate film choices in english. decent meal, wholesome snack - more substantive than ana which i flew to tokyo from delhi last month. absolutely nothing wrong in traveling this airline. asked for a gin and tonic, got two without asking. just don't understand why people criticize this airline so much. it's my preferred choice in economy when possible.",	 Predicted class: 0,	 Actual class:1
