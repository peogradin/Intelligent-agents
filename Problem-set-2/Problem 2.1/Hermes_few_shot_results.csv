If you know both the actual brightness of an object and its apparent brightness from your location then with no other information you can estimate:,Its speed relative to you,Its composition,Its size,Its distance from you,D,D," D

Explanation: The inverse square law states that the intensity of light decreases as the square of the distance. So if you know both brightnesses, then you can calculate the distance using the formula $d = \sqrt{\frac{B_a}{B_o}}$ where $B_a$ is apparent brightness and $B_o$ is actual brightness."
Why is the sky blue?,Because the molecules that compose the Earth's atmosphere have a blue-ish color.,Because the sky reflects the color of the Earth's oceans.,Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.,Because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially absorbs all other colors.,C,C, C
"Some of Mars'water is frozen in the soil and the ice caps and some was lost due to solar wind stripping but much of the original water is thought to have been lost through another mechanism.

What is the source of the material that causes meteor showers?,Near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital path. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an asteroid we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.,Near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky.,The nuclei of comets disintigrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a central location in the sky.,The nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along the comet's orbital path. When the Earth passes through the orbit of a comet we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.,D,C, C
Why does the plasma (ion) tail of a comet always point away from the Sun?,Radiation pressure from the Sun's light pushes the ions away.,The conservation of the angular momentum in the tail keeps it always pointing away from the Sun.,The ions are following Keplerian orbits that lead away from the Sun.,"The solar wind electromagnetically ""blows"" the ions directly away from the Sun.",D,D, D
How did Eratosthenes estimate the size of Earth in 240 B.C.?,By observing the duration of a solar eclipse.,By measuring the size of Earth's shadow on the Moon in a lunar eclipse.,By comparing the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.,By sending fleets of ships around Earth.,C,C," C

The answer is ""C"" because Eratosthenes measured the angle between a vertical stick at Syene (Aswan) and the Sun's altitude in Alexandria, Egypt. He knew that Syene was on the Tropic of Cancer, so he assumed that the Sun was directly overhead there during midsummer. By measuring the difference in angles between the two cities, Eratosthenes could estimate Earth's circumference."

Why are the inner planets made of denser materials than the outer planets?,In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.,In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.,Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.,When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.,B,B, B
What do meteorites reveal about the solar system?,They reveal that the early solar system consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium gas.,They reveal that meteorites are much older than the comets and planets.,They reveal that the age of the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years.,They reveal that the solar system once contained 10 planets.,C,C,"
    • A - No, because hydrogen and helium gas are not found in meteorites; they are found in Jupiter-like planets.
    • B - No, because comets can be older than some meteorites but younger than the solar system itself.
    • C - Yes, this is one of the ways we know that the age of the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years. Meteorites are found all over Earth and they contain rocks from other planets and asteroids in our solar system. Some meteorites have been dated to be about 4.5 billion years old, which is the same as the oldest known rocks on Earth.
    • D - No, because we know that there were only eight planets when Pluto was demoted; it's now considered a ""dwarf planet."""

Life on Earth originated from,We don't know for sure.,aliens (panspermia).,comets.,the Earth's oceans.,A,A," A

The reason we can't say that life on Earth originated from any of these options is because scientists are still trying to figure out exactly how and where life began, although most theories suggest it came from organic molecules in Earth's early oceans (option D). Panspermia (option B) suggests that life may have come from space, but this theory remains unproven. Comets (C) are not the source of life on Earth; they just contain some simple organic compounds."
