"What is true for a type-Ia (""type one-a"") supernova?",This type occurs in binary systems.,This type occurs in young galaxies.,This type produces gamma-ray bursts.,This type produces high amounts of X-rays.,A,A," A
Explanation: Type Ia supernovae occur when a white dwarf star accretes matter from its companion until it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit and undergoes an explosion, typically in binary systems where one component is a white dwarf and another is a main-sequence or giant star. They do not produce gamma-ray bursts nor high amounts of X-rays; they are most often observed in galaxies like our own Milky Way (not young galaxies)."
If you know both the actual brightness of an object and its apparent brightness from your location then with no other information you can estimate:,Its speed relative to you,Its composition,Its size,Its distance from you,D,D," D
Explanation: The inverse square law tells us that the intensity of light (or any radiation) decreases as the square of the distance between the source and observer. Therefore, if we know an object's actual brightness and its apparent brightness, then by comparing these two values we can estimate how far away it is from us."
Why is the sky blue?,Because the molecules that compose the Earth's atmosphere have a blue-ish color.,Because the sky reflects the color of the Earth's oceans.,Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.,Because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially absorbs all other colors.,C,C, C
"Some of Mars'water is frozen in the soil and the ice caps and some was lost due to solar wind stripping but much of the original water is thought to have been lost through another mechanism. What happened to this ""lost""water?",it was stripped away by the magnetic field when it rapidly decreased in strength,it was broken into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape,it was consumed by a civilization of thirsty Martians,it was vaporized during a period of intense volcanism and was lost to space through thermal escape,B,B, B.
Most rocks on the Moon's surface are older than those on the Earth's surface. The best evidence for this is:,Lunar rocks are composed of fragments pulverized by many impacts.,Radioactive dating of lunar samples shows that they are older.,The Moon's surface is more heavily eroded than the Earth's surface.,The Moon's surface has more impact craters than the Earth's surface.,B,B, B
What is the second most common element in the solar system?,Iron,Hydrogen,Methane,Helium,D,D," D. Helium

Helium, an odorless and colorless gas, was discovered by Sir William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh in 1894. It is the second most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen, but it is relatively rare on Earth because of its low boiling point (-268.93 °C or -452.07 °F) which allows it to escape into space from Earth's atmosphere.

Helium has several uses including filling balloons and blimps due to its inertness, being used as a protective atmosphere for welding and high-temperature industrial processes because of its low reactivity with other elements, and serving as an oxidizer (oxygen source) in rocket fuels.

Helium is also important in medical applications such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), where it is used to create a non-conductive"
What is the source of the material that causes meteor showers?,Near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital path. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an asteroid we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.,Near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky.,The nuclei of comets disintigrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a central location in the sky.,The nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along the comet's orbital path. When the Earth passes through the orbit of a comet we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.,D,," C, D"
Why does the plasma (ion) tail of a comet always point away from the Sun?,Radiation pressure from the Sun's light pushes the ions away.,The conservation of the angular momentum in the tail keeps it always pointing away from the Sun.,The ions are following Keplerian orbits that lead away from the Sun.,"The solar wind electromagnetically ""blows"" the ions directly away from the Sun.",D,D," D
Explanation: The plasma tail of a comet always points away from the Sun because it is being blown by the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles (mostly protons) flowing outward from the Sun in all directions. As these charged particles collide with the positively-charged ions that make up the comet's tail, they transfer momentum to them and push them away from the Sun."
How did Eratosthenes estimate the size of Earth in 240 B.C.?,By observing the duration of a solar eclipse.,By measuring the size of Earth's shadow on the Moon in a lunar eclipse.,By comparing the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.,By sending fleets of ships around Earth.,C,C," C
Eratosthenes, an ancient Greek mathematician and scholar, used a method that involved measuring the angle between the sun's rays at two cities located at different latitudes. This is known as the Eratosthenes method or the shadow-length method. The idea behind this method was to use the fact that when the sun is directly overhead (i.e., at noon), its altitude in the sky depends on the observer's latitude. In other words, if you are at the equator and it's noon, the sun will be exactly overhead; but if you are further away from the equator, the sun will not be directly overhead. By measuring this angle (which is equal to twice the difference in latitudes between two cities), one can estimate Earth's circumference.

In 240 B.C., Eratosthenes was able to measure the angle at Syene (modern-"
The Large Magellanic Cloud is ...,a dwarf galaxy orbiting the Milky Way.,the closest planetary nebula to the Earth.,a bright star cluster discovered by Magellan.,the outer arm of the Milky Way named after Magellan.,A,A, A
Why do we look for water-ice in craters at Mercury's pole?,Actually water-ice is all over Mercury and not just at the poles.,The pole is the only place fortunate enough to have had comet impacts,Radar from the earth can only see Mercury's poles.,These craters contain the only permanently shadowed regions on Mercury,D,D," D
Explanation: Water-ice has been found in certain craters at both of Mercury’s poles, and these are the only places where water ice can be stable because they are always in permanent shadow."
On which planet in our solar system can you find the Great Red Spot?,Venus,Mars,Jupiter,Saturn,C,C," C

The Great Red Spot is an enormous storm on the gas giant planet of Jupiter. It has been raging for at least 300 years and possibly as long as 4,000 years! The spot appears red because it contains a significant amount of ammonia particles in its clouds. This colossal storm measures about 10,000 miles across, which is more than twice the width of Earth.

The Great Red Spot on Jupiter was first observed by astronomer Robert Hooke in 1664 and has been visible ever since with telescopes. It’s a giant storm that rotates counterclockwise around its own axis. The winds inside this storm can reach speeds up to 400 kilometers per hour (250 miles per hour).

The Great Red Spot is not the only large storm on Jupiter, but it is by far the most famous and longest-lasting one"
Why does Earth have the strongest magnetic field among the terrestrial worlds?,It is by far the largest terrestrial world.,It is the most volcanically active world.,It is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.,It rotates much faster than any other terrestrial world.,C,C, C
Which of the following is not true?,The Earth and Venus are in a 1:1 orbital resonance (for every 1 Earth orbit there is exactly 1 Venus orbit),Neptune and Pluto are in a 3:2 orbital resonance (for every 3 Neptune orbits there are exactly 2 Pluto orbits),The Kirkwood Gaps in the asteroid belt are due to resonances with Jupiter,Neptune and Pluto won't collide because of their orbital resonance,A,B, B
The lithosphere of a planet is the layer that consists of,the softer rocky material of the mantle.,the lava that comes out of volcanoes.,material between the crust and the mantle.,the rigid rocky material of the crust and uppermost portion of the mantle.,D,D," D
Explanation: The lithosphere is the outer, brittle layer of a terrestrial celestial body such as a planet or natural satellite. It consists of the crust and the rigid, solid part of the upper mantle immediately beneath it. On Earth, this includes both the continental and oceanic crusts, which are composed mainly of granitic and basaltic rocks respectively. The lithosphere is relatively thin on a planet like Venus or Earth where there is plate tectonics (around 100 km thick), but can be much thicker in other planets such as Mars or the Moon where no plate tectonics occur, reaching up to 350-400 km.

The lithosphere behaves like a rigid shell and is broken into several large plates that move relative to one another at their boundaries due to convection currents in the underlying asthenosphere ("
What is the Cassini division of Saturn's rings?,a dark ring visible from Earth composed of dark dusty particles,the most opaque ring of Saturn made of highly reflective ice particles,the widest ring of Saturn located between two large ring gaps,a large gap visible from Earth produced by an orbital resonance with the moon Mimas,D,D," D
Explanation: The Cassini division is not a dark or opaque ring, but rather a wide gap in Saturn's rings. This gap was named after Giovanni Domenico Cassini who first observed it in 1675 using a telescope. It exists because the moon Mimas causes particles within this region to be shepherded into two narrower rings on either side of the division, due to an orbital resonance with Mimas."
Which of the following statements about sidereal and solar days is not true?,The time it takes for the Sun to make one circuit of our sky is one solar day.,A solar day is 4 minutes longer than a sidereal day.,A solar day represents more than 360 degrees of rotation for the earth.,The time it takes for the Moon to make one circuit of our sky is one solar day.,D,D, D
Meteorites with high metal content probably are,pieces of comets rather than of asteroids.,chunks of large differentiated asteroids that were shattered by collisions.,chunks of rock chipped off the planet Mars.,leftover chunks of rock from the earliest period in the formation of the solar system.,B,B," B
Explanation: Meteorites with high metal content are probably pieces of differentiated asteroids that were shattered by collisions. Differentiation is a process whereby heavier elements, such as metals and sulfur compounds, sink to the center of an object while lighter materials rise to the outer layers. Since large asteroids have undergone this process, they contain metal-rich cores surrounded by less dense rocky material. When these differentiated asteroids collide with other objects in space, chunks containing high concentrations of metals can be blasted off and eventually land on Earth as meteorites.

Meteorites from comets would not have a high metal content because they are made mostly of ice, dust, and rocky material. Meteorites from Mars would contain iron but not in the same concentrations as differentiated asteroids since Mars is predominantly composed of basaltic rocks. Finally, meteor"
The four big moons of Jupiter are Callisto Europa Ganymede and Io. Which one of them has the smallest distance to Jupiter?,Callisto,Europa,Ganymede,Io,D,D," D

Ganymede is the largest moon in our solar system, but it's not the closest to its planet. That honor goes to Io, which has a distance of about 262,000 miles (421,700 kilometers) from Jupiter. Ganymede is at an average distance of about 358,000 miles (576,000 km), followed by Europa at around 410,000 miles (660,000 km). Callisto is the farthest away from Jupiter with a distance of about 920,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) [source: NASA]."
Why are the season's in Mars' southern hemisphere so extreme?,because Mars is farther from the sun than the Earth,because Mars has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than the Earth,because Mars has a more eccentric orbit than the Earth,because Mars' axis is more tilted than the Earth's,C,D," D
Explanation: The seasons on Mars are much more extreme than those experienced here on Earth. This is primarily due to the fact that Mars' axis of rotation is tilted at an angle of about 25 degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun, compared with a tilt of only 23.5 degrees for Earth. As a result, when Mars is at its closest point (perihelion) or farthest point (aphelion) in its eccentric orbit, one hemisphere will receive much more sunlight than the other, causing extreme seasonal variations."
What is the significance of the 1:2:4 resonance in the Jupiter's moons system?,The resonance pulls Io in different directions and generates heat.,It makes the orbit of Io slightly elliptical.,It creates a gap with no asteriods between the orbits.,It prevents formation of the ring material into other moons.,B,D," D
Explanation: The 1:2:4 resonance in Jupiter's moon system refers to the fact that Io, Europa and Ganymede complete their orbits around Jupiter twice, four times and once respectively for every orbit of Jupiter. This means that while one moon completes two orbits, the other has completed only one orbit. The tidal forces created by this resonance prevent the formation of ring material into new moons.

The terrestrial planet cores contain mostly metal because,the entire planets are made mostly of metal.,metals condensed first in the solar nebula and the rocks then accreted around them.,metals sank to the center during a time when the interiors were molten throughout.,radioactivity created metals in the core from the decay of uranium.,C,B," B

Explanation: In the early stages of planetary formation, metal and rocky materials condensed at different temperatures. Metals (Fe, Ni) formed first at high temperatures, while silicates (rocky material) required lower temperatures to form. The metals sank towards the center due to their higher density, but the rocks could not accrete around them because they were too hot and viscous. Thus, cores of terrestrial planets are mostly metal."
Why are the inner planets made of denser materials than the outer planets?,In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.,In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.,Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.,When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.,B,," B, D"
What do meteorites reveal about the solar system?,They reveal that the early solar system consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium gas.,They reveal that meteorites are much older than the comets and planets.,They reveal that the age of the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years.,They reveal that the solar system once contained 10 planets.,C,C," C
Explanation: Meteorites, which are small pieces of rock or metal from space that land on Earth, can be dated using radiometric dating techniques to determine their age. By studying these meteorites, scientists have determined that the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years old."
Planetary rings are,known to exist for all of the jovian planets.,composed of a large number of individual particles that orbit their planet in accord with Kepler's third law.,nearer to their planet than any of the planet's large moons.,all of the above,D,D," D

Planetary rings are known to exist for all of the jovian planets, and they are composed of a large number of individual particles that orbit their planet in accord with Kepler's third law. These rings are also nearer to their planet than any of the planet's large moons."
Suppose the angular separation of two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of your eyes. How will the stars appear to your eyes?,You will not be able to see these two stars at all.,You will see two distinct stars.,The two stars will look like a single point of light.,The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.,C,C, C
What is not true of Jupiter's magnetic field?,it is about 20000 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field,"it traps charged particles from Io's volcanoes in a ""plasma torus"" around the planet",it causes spectacular auroral displays at Jupiter's north and south poles,it switches polarity every 11 years,D,D," D
Explanation: Jupiter's magnetic field is about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's. It traps charged particles from Io in a ""plasma torus"" around the planet and causes spectacular auroral displays at its north and south poles. However, unlike Earth's magnetic field which reverses its polarity every few hundred thousand years or so, Jupiter's magnetic field does not switch polarity every 11 years as stated in option D."
What does the astronomical term ecliptic describe?,The path of the Sun in the sky throughout a year.,The axial tilt of the Earth throughout a year.,The movement of the stars due to Earthâ€™s rotation.,The central line through the axis of rotation.,A,D," D
The ecliptic is an imaginary line in space that represents the plane of Earth's equator when projected onto the celestial sphere, and it serves as a reference for astronomers to describe the position of celestial objects relative to Earth's orbit around the Sun. The term ""ecliptic"" comes from the Greek word eklipsein, meaning ""to occult,"" or hide, because when one planet is in front of another along the ecliptic plane, it can appear to pass in front of the other and thus be hidden from view.
The Sun's apparent path across the sky varies slightly throughout the year due to Earth's axial tilt (option B), but this variation does not change the fact that the Sun appears to follow a specific line in the sky, which is the ecliptic (option A). The movement of stars due to Earth's rotation (option C) describes precession and"
The so-called dark energy is a model to explain ...,the radiation of black holes.,the mass distribution of galaxies.,the acceleration of the universe.,the microwave background of the universe.,C,C," C

The concept of ""dark energy"" was introduced in the early 1990s to explain observations that indicated the expansion of the Universe is actually speeding up, rather than slowing down as expected due to gravity from all the matter and energy we can see. This means there must be some other form of energy that permeates space and exerts a repulsive force counteracting gravity. The most popular model for this dark energy is known as ""cosmological constant"" or simply lambda, which represents an inherent property of empty space that has the effect of causing it to expand at an accelerating rate."
How do scientists know that the majority of meteorites come from the asteroid belt?,Bubbles of gas trapped in the crystals within meteorites are identical to the gases trapped in asteroids.,The spectra of some meteorites are similar to the spectra of asteroids in the asteroid belt.,Collisions are common in the asteroid belt and we can track the fragments from their source asteroid to the Earth where they become meteorites.,The asteroid belt is the only possible source of meteorites therefore they must originate there.,B,B," B
Bubbles of gas trapped in the crystals within meteorites are identical to the gases trapped in asteroids."
"Jupiter and the other jovian planets are sometimes called ""gas giants."" In what sense is this term misleading?",The materials they are made of are not normally gaseous in everyday experience.,They actually contain a significant fraction of non-gaseous matter.,The materials that make up these planets are primarily in the form of a plasma not a gas.,Actually it's a great description because these worlds are big and gaseous throughout.,B,B, B
Which of the following is not one of nor follows directly from Kepler's laws?,As a planet moves around its orbit it sweeps out equal areas in equal times.,The orbit of each planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.,The force of attraction between any two objects decreases with the square of the distance between their centers.,A planet travels faster when it is nearer to the Sun and slower when it is farther from the Sun.,C,C, C
The name of the black hole in the center of our Milky Way is ...,Altair A*,Alsephina A*,Fomalhaut A*,Sagittarius A*,D,D," D
Explanation: Sagittarius A* (pronounced ""Sagittarius A-star"") is the supermassive black hole located at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. It has a mass between 2.5 and 4.3 million times that of the Sun, and its event horizon is about 10 microarcseconds in diameter (or about 17 billion kilometers across).

Note: The other options listed are all real stars, but they have nothing to do with our galaxy's black hole. Altair A* is a star in the constellation Aquila; Alsephina A* and Fomalhaut A* are both stars in the constellations of Corvus and Sagittarius respectively."
Why is Saturn almost as big as Jupiter despite its smaller mass?,Jupiter's greater mass compresses it more thus increasing its density.,Saturn has a larger proportion of hydrogen and helium than Jupiter and is therefore less dense.,Jupiter's strong magnetic field constrains its size.,Saturn is further from the Sun thus cooler and therefore less compact.,A,B, B
Which of these has NOT been one of the main hypotheses considered for the origin of the Moon?,The Moon split from the Earth due to tidal forces.,The Moon was captured into Earth orbit.,The Earth and Moon co-accreted in the solar nebula.,Earth was rotating so rapidly that the Moon split from it.,A,D, D
We were first able to accurately measure the diameter of Pluto from:,a New Horizons flyby in the 1990s,Hubble Space Telescope images that resolved Pluto's disk,brightness measurements made during mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon,radar observations made by the Arecibo telescope,C,B," B
Explanation: In 1978, a series of Hubble Space Telescope images resolved Pluto's disk. These images allowed scientists to accurately measure its diameter for the first time. Option D is incorrect because radar observations are not able to resolve objects as small and far away as Pluto."
According to the Solar Nebular theory what are asteroids and comets?,They are the shattered remains of collisions between planets.,They are chunks of rock or ice that condensed long after the planets and moons had formed.,They are chunks of rock or ice that were expelled from planets by volcanoes.,They are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets.,D,D," D
Explanation: According to the Solar Nebular theory, asteroids and comets are small bodies (planetesimals) that did not grow large enough to become a full-sized planet or moon. These leftover planetesimals never accreted into planets because they were too small to pull in more material as gravity slowed down, or they were ejected from the solar system by other larger bodies during collisions.

The Solar Nebular theory is one of several theories that attempt to explain how our solar system formed. It suggests that a giant cloud of gas and dust (the nebula) collapsed under its own gravity to form the Sun in the center, with the planets forming from material left over after the sun had condensed.

Asteroids are rocky bodies found primarily between Mars and Jupiter, while comets usually orbit much farther out from the sun. Both asteroids and comets can occasionally be brought closer to Earth"
How do we know how old the Earth is?,From the layering of materials within the Earth.,From fossils of ancient life.,From the cratering history of Earthâ€™s surface.,From radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites.,D,D," D
Explanation: Radioactive decay is a process in which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation, such as alpha particles or beta particles. The rate at which this occurs depends on the type of atom involved; for<|im_start|>... See more questions about Earth's age and geology</s> 

The answer to the question ""How do we know how old the Earth is?"" is D: From radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites. Radioactive decay is a process in which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation, such as alpha particles or beta particles. The rate at which this occurs depends on the type of atom involved; for example, carbon-14 has a half-life of about 5730 years, while uranium-238 has a half-life of over four billion years. By measuring the amount of radioactive decay in rocks and meteorites, scientists"
Life on Earth originated from,We don't know for sure.,aliens (panspermia).,comets.,the Earth's oceans.,A,D," D

The current scientific consensus is that life on Earth arose in the ocean, or more specifically, near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the sea. This idea was first proposed by Thomas Gold in 1960 and later supported by experiments showing that certain organic compounds could be synthesized under conditions similar to those found around deep-sea hydrothermal vents.

This is a very simplified explanation, but it gives you an idea of how life might have originated on Earth."
By locating the north celestial pole (NCP) in the sky how can you determine your latitude?,The azimuth of the NCP is the angular distance from the North Pole.,The azimuth of the NCP is the same as your latitude.,The altitude of the NCP is the same as your latitude.,The altitude of the NCP is your angular distance from the North Pole.,C,B," B and D
Explanation: At any location on Earth, the north celestial pole (NCP) lies directly overhead at that point when it culminates. Therefore, both its azimuth (the angle east or west of true north) and altitude (its angular distance from the zenith) are equal to your latitude."
Why is Saturn almost as big as Jupiter despite its smaller mass?,Jupiter's greater mass compresses it more thus increasing its density.,Saturn has a larger proportion of hydrogen and helium than Jupiter and is therefore less dense.,Saturn is further from the Sun thus cooler and therefore less compact.,Saturn's rings make the planet look bigger.,A,C," C
Saturn, like all gas giants, has a lower density because it consists mostly of hydrogen and helium which are relatively light elements. However, these planets have such large masses that their volumes are also very large. Saturn is about 95 times the mass of Earth but its volume is almost 784 times greater than Earth's volume. Therefore even though Jupiter has a higher density (because it has more heavy elements like carbon and nitrogen), Jupiter is only slightly larger in diameter than Saturn, at about 139,820 km compared to Saturn's 116,460 km.
Saturn's rings do not affect its size but they make it look bigger because we can see them from Earth."
Calculate the ratio of the solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface for perihelion (0.304 AU) versus aphelion (0.456 AU).,04:01,01:02,06:05,09:04,D,C," C
Explanation: The ratio of the solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface for perihelion (0.304 AU) versus aphelion (0.456 AU) is calculated by dividing the distance from the Sun at aphelion by that at perihelion, which gives us 0.456/0.304 = 1.50296... This means that Mercury receives about 5% less solar radiation flux when it's furthest away from the sun (aphelion) compared to when it's closest (perihelion). Therefore, the answer is C: 06:05 or 6 parts for perihelion and 5 parts for aphelion."
The terrestrial planet cores contain mostly metal because,the entire planets are made mostly of metal.,radioactivity created metals in the core from the decay of uranium.,metals condensed first in the solar nebula and the rocks then accreted around them.,metals differentiated to the center during a time when the interiors were molten throughout.,D,," C, D"
Which of the following countries has sent landers to Venus?,The U.S.S.R.,The U.S.,France,A and B,A,D," D
Explanation: Both the United States (U.S.) and the former Soviet Union (now Russia) have sent landers to Venus, but not France."
Which of the following is/are NOT caused by orbital resonance?,2:3 periodic ratio of Neptune:Pluto,Kirkwood Gaps.,Gaps in Saturn's rings.,Breaking of small Jovian moons to form ring materials.,D,C," C
Explanation: Orbital resonance is a phenomenon where the orbital period (time taken for one orbit) of two celestial bodies are related by a simple ratio, such as 2:3 or 1:2 etc. This leads to periodic gravitational perturbations that can cause instability in the system and lead to various effects like Kirkwood gaps in asteroid belts, breaking up of small moons around gas giants into ring materials etc. However, orbital resonance is not responsible for the gaps seen in Saturn's rings as these are caused by shepherd moons that keep the ring material confined between them and prevent it from spreading out or settling down to form a single plane."
Which of the following moons is NOT one of the Galilean moons?,Ganymede,Callisto,Europa,Dione,D,D,"
D. Dione is not one of the Galilean moons."
When will the next major impact occur on Earth?,Hundreds of millennia in the future.,Major impacts can no longer occur since the period of heavy bombardment is over.,Hundreds of millennia after the last major impact.,Could be any time. The probability of impact is the same next year as it is for any later year.,D,D," D
Explanation: Major impacts on Earth are unpredictable and can occur at any time, though they happen very infrequently."
What about asteroids makes them stand out in sky surveys searching for them?,Asteroids emit pulsed radiation,Asteroids emit a lot of their own radiation,They reflect enough of the sun's light to make them brighter than most background stars,Asteroids have substantial motion relative to the background stars,D,D, D. Asteroids have substantial motion relative to the background stars
Why did the solar nebula heat up as it collapsed?,Collisions among planetesimals generated friction and heat.,Radiation from other nearby stars that had formed earlier heated the nebula.,The shock wave from a nearby supernova heated the gas.,As the cloud shrank its gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy and then into thermal energy.,D,D," D
The solar nebula, which eventually formed our sun and planets, started as a large cloud of gas and dust in space. This cloud began collapsing under the influence of gravity. As it collapsed its gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy, meaning that particles within the cloud were moving faster. Then this kinetic energy was converted into thermal or heat energy. The result is that the solar nebula heated up as it shrank."
Which of the following most likely explains why Venus does not have a strong magnetic field?,Its rotation is too slow.,It has too thick an atmosphere.,It is too large.,It does not have a metallic core.,A,D," D
Explanation: A planet's magnetic field arises from the motion of its molten iron-nickel core, which generates electric currents that create a magnetic field. Venus has no strong magnetic field because it lacks a dynamo mechanism in its core. This is due to the fact that while Venus does have a large metallic core (C), it is not molten and thus cannot generate an electromagnetic field."
