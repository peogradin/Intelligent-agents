I'm happy to help you with your astronomy questions! Here are my answers:

1. Which of the following characteristics would not necessarily suggest that a rock we found is a meteorite?

A: It has a fusion crust
B: It contains solidified spherical droplets (stony-iron nodules)
C: It is highly processed

Answer: C

Reasoning: A and B are both characteristic features of meteorites, while high processing could be due to various geological processes on Earth.

2. Which is not a similarity between Saturn's and Jupiter's atmospheres?

A: Composition dominated by hydrogen and helium

Why are the inner planets made of denser materials than the outer planets?,In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.,In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.,Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.,When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.,B,B," ???

I'd be happy to help you with your astronomy questions! However, please note that these multiple-choice questions were designed for a specific level of knowledge and may not accurately reflect your current understanding.

As for the question about why inner planets are made of denser materials than outer planets, the answer B: ""In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions."" is correct. This is due to the temperature gradient within the solar nebula, with higher temperatures near the Sun and lower temperatures farther out.
