Why is the sky blue?	Because the molecules that compose the Earth's atmosphere have a blue-ish color.	Because the sky reflects the color of the Earth's oceans.	Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.	Because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially absorbs all other colors.	C
Some of Mars'water is frozen in the soil and the ice caps and some was lost due to solar wind stripping but much of the original water is thought to have been lost through another mechanism. What happened to this "lost"water?	it was stripped away by the magnetic field when it rapidly decreased in strength	it was broken into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape	it was consumed by a civilization of thirsty Martians	it was vaporized during a period of intense volcanism and was lost to space through thermal escape	B
Most rocks on the Moon's surface are older than those on the Earth's surface. The best evidence for this is:	Lunar rocks are composed of fragments pulverized by many impacts.

B

What is the source of the material that causes meteor showers?	Near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital path. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an asteroid we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.	Near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky.	The nuclei of comets disintigrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a central location in the sky.	The nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along the comet's orbital path. When the Earth passes through the orbit of a comet we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.	D
Why does the plasma (ion) tail of a comet always point away from the Sun?	Radiation pressure from the Sun's light pushes the ions away.	The conservation of the angular momentum in the tail keeps it always pointing away from the Sun.	The ions are following Keplerian orbits that lead away from the Sun.	The solar wind electromagnetically "blows" the ions directly away from the Sun.	D
How did Eratosthenes estimate the size of Earth in 240 B.C.?	By observing the duration of a solar eclipse.	By measuring the size of Earth's shadow on the Moon in a lunar eclipse.

The time it takes for the Moon to make one circuit of our sky is one solar day.	D

Why are the season's in Mars' southern hemisphere so extreme?	because Mars is farther from the sun than the Earth	because Mars has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than the Earth	because Mars has a more eccentric orbit than the Earth	because Mars' axis is more tilted than the Earth's	C
What is the significance of the 1:2:4 resonance in the Jupiter's moons system?	The resonance pulls Io in different directions and generates heat.	It makes the orbit of Io slightly elliptical.	It creates a gap with no asteriods between the orbits.	It prevents formation of the ring material into other moons.	B
The terrestrial planet cores contain mostly metal because	the entire planets are made mostly of metal.	metals condensed first in the solar nebula and the rocks then accreted around them.	metals sank to the center during a time when the interiors were molten throughout.	radioactivity created metals in the core from the decay of uranium.	C
Why are the inner planets made of denser materials than the outer planets?	In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.	In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.	Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.	When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.	B
What do meteorites reveal about the solar system?	They reveal that the early solar system consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium gas.	They reveal that meteorites are much older than the comets and planets.	They reveal that the age of the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years.

Suppose the angular separation of two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of your eyes. How will the stars appear to your eyes?	You will not be able to see these two stars at all.	You will see two distinct stars.	The two stars will look like a single point of light.	The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.	C

How do scientists know that the majority of meteorites come from the asteroid belt?	Bubbles of gas trapped in the crystals within meteorites are identical to the gases trapped in asteroids.	The spectra of some meteorites are similar to the spectra of asteroids in the asteroid belt.	Collisions are common in the asteroid belt and we can track the fragments from their source asteroid to the Earth where they become meteorites.	The asteroid belt is the only possible source of meteorites therefore they must originate there.	B
Jupiter and the other jovian planets are sometimes called "gas giants." In what sense is this term misleading?	The materials they are made of are not normally gaseous in everyday experience.	They actually contain a significant fraction of non-gaseous matter.	The materials that make up these planets are primarily in the form of a plasma not a gas.	Actually it's a great description because these worlds are big and gaseous throughout.	B
Which of the following is not one of nor follows directly from Kepler's laws?	As a planet moves around its orbit it sweeps out equal areas in equal times.	The orbit of each planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.	The force of attraction between any two objects decreases with the square of the distance between their centers.	A planet travels faster when it is nearer to the Sun and slower when it is farther from the Sun.	C

Why is Saturn almost as big as Jupiter despite its smaller mass?	Jupiter's greater mass compresses it more thus increasing its density.	Saturn has a larger proportion of hydrogen and helium than Jupiter and is therefore less dense.	Jupiter's strong magnetic field constrains its size.	Saturn is further from the Sun thus cooler and therefore less compact.	A
Which of these has NOT been one of the main hypotheses considered for the origin of the Moon?	The Moon split from the Earth due to tidal forces.	The Moon was captured into Earth orbit.	The Earth and Moon co-accreted in the solar nebula.	Earth was rotating so rapidly that the Moon split from it.	A

The azimuth of the NCP is the same as your latitude.	The altitude of the NCP is the same as your latitude.	The altitude of the NCP is your angular distance from the North Pole.	C
Why is Saturn almost as big as Jupiter despite its smaller mass?	Jupiter's greater mass compresses it more thus increasing its density.
